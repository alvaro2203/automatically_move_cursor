# automatically_move_cursor

This repository contains a Python application built using the PyAutoGUI library to control mouse cursor movements. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using the Tkinter library, allowing users to start and stop automated cursor movements, adjust the interval between movements, and view the log of cursor movements. The application is suitable for tasks requiring automated cursor movements, such as simulating user interaction for testing or demonstration purposes.
